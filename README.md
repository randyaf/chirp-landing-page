# chirp-landing-page
This is a Chirp Landing Page that is part of the [Codewell challenge](https://www.codewell.cc/challenges/chirp-landing-page--60fc1e36a383e41090a3c71c). I created this landing page 
to improve my understanding of HTML and CSS.
Although the design is not that complicated, the process of making this landing page 
really strengthen my understanding of HTML structures and CSS Flexbox.

The result is not as 100% pixel-perfect as the provided design, but I tried to follow 
the overall design as I can.
